Add a contact form to any post or page by inserting `[contact-form]` in the post. Emails will be sent to the post's author. As seen on WordPress.com.

== Description ==

Add a contact form to any post or page by inserting `[contact-form]` in the post. Emails will be sent to the post's author.

Your email address is never shown, and the sender never learns it (unless you reply to the email).

As seen on WordPress.com.

This plugin was imported from [Grunion Contact Form](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/grunion-contact-form/ "Grunion Contact Form - wordpress.org") but it adds full internazionalitazion using localized string from Wordpress core.

An e-mail [signature block](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_block "Signature block - Wikipedia") was appended to the end of the e-mail message containing the sender's name, email address, website and IP and delimited from the body of the message by a single line consisting of exactly two hyphens, followed by a space, followed by the end of line ("-- \n"). This [signature cut line](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3676#section-4.3 "Usenet Signature Convention - RFC3676 - IETF") allows software to automatically mark or remove the sig block.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `send-e-mail` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Add a contact form to any post or page by inserting `[contact-form]` in the post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about localization ? =

This plugin was full internazionalitazed beacuse use localized string from Wordpress core.

= What about spam? Will I get a lot from the contact form? =

If you have [Akismet](http://akismet.com/ "Akismet Site") installed on your blog, you may get some spam, but you shouldn't get a lot.
All the messages people send to you through the contact form will be filtered through Akismet.

= Anyone can put whatever they want in the name and email boxes. How can I know who's really sending the message? =

If a logged member of your site sends you a message, the end of the email will let you know that the message was sent by a verified user.
Otherwise, you can't trust anything... just like a blog comment.

Anonymity is both a curse and a blessing :)

= My blog has multiple authors. Who gets the email? =

The email is sent to the author of the post with the contact form in it. So each author on your blog can have his or her own contact form.

= Great! But how will my visitors know who they're sending a message to? =

Just make the title of your post "Contact Mary" or put "Hey, drop John a line with the form below" in the body of your post.
